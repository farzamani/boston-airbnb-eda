## What is this project?
Long story short, imagine there is a housing company that wants to invest their money to become a host in Boston Area and make a listing in Airbnb. Letâ€™s say the budget is not an issue and they wish to make a lot of income out of their investment.

Which neighborhood that they should choose? What should the homestay look like? Apartment or house? How much price they should put for the listing?
